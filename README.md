# 📄 ChatPDF – End-to-End RAG Application with Streamlit & LangChain

ChatPDF is a **full end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application** that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask natural language questions.  
The system retrieves relevant content from the PDF using **FAISS vector search** and generates answers using **LLMs (OpenAI or Google Gemini)**.

This project is built using the **latest LangChain Runnable API**, optimized with **Streamlit caching**, and designed to be **cost-efficient, scalable, and resume-ready**.

## 🔥 Why This Project?

- Demonstrates **real-world RAG architecture**
- Handles **API quota limitations** correctly
- Uses **local embeddings** to avoid cost issues
- Shows **production-level optimization**
- Ideal for **Data Scientist / ML Engineer / GenAI roles**
